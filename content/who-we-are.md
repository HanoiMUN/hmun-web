# What is HMUN?

Hanoi Model United Nations Organization (HMUN Org.) is a student-run
organization bringing together like-minded individuals who share a passion for
contemporary global issues and international relations. Located in Hanoi, the
capital city of Vietnam, HMUN operated year-round with numerous activities
revolving around Model United Nations, including:
1. The annual main conference in August;
2. Mock Model UNs (two-day Model UN simulation);
3. Training sessions for Delegates and Organizers on how Model UN works and how
a Model UN Organization operates;
4. Community service activities for students to help their local communities
with knowledge learned from Model UN.

# Our story

Since its inception in 2015, Hanoi Model United Nations (HMUN) has grown into
one of the most anticipated Model United Nations conferences in Vietnam. With a
team of around 100 passionate and professional team members, HMUN has gone
through eight sessions, achieving roaring successs, gaining widespread
publicity, and receiving positive responses from Vietnamese and international
students. With growing popularity, our latest conference has drawn in more than
100 Delegates together with more than 40 Delegates attending our Mock
conferences.

In August 2019, HMUN transformed itself from an annual event into an
organization with year-round operations. We strive to provide better access to
Model UN conferences for students and intensive training for both our members
and participants. Our organization endeavors to equip and empower students with
an appreciation for differing viewpoints, gain first-hand experience of
diplomacy, thus fostering critical thinking skills, cross-cultural
understanding, and self-confidence. We hope that through their experience with
HMUN, participants can leave with valuable knowledge, a growing sense of
responsibility towards global issues, and a concrete commitment as Agents of
Change for tomorrow.
