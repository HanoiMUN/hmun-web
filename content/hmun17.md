<br/>

- “I love FCC so much!!! The whole committee is like a family too me. Although everyone (including me) were a bit shy at first, everything turned out great in the end! The CDs are the best ever; they really care about us and they're so friendly! The Chairs are also super friendly and awesome and amazing. The committee was a lot of fun and it really lights up my passion for MUN.”
