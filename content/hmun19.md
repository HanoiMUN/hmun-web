<br/>

One of HMUN's main focus was its newbie-friendliness and HMUN'19 truly delivered. Although I'm not a first-time MUNer at HMUN '19, I was my first time being in a crisis council and I did worry a lot. Throughout the conference, I made various mistakes and constantly stressed out by the committee's fast pace. However, the staffs' friendliness and the assistance from chairs and crisis directors helped me a lot with understanding how the council worked and finding out what I have to do. Without help from the dais, I would not have learned as much as I did. To me, HMUN’19 was such a delightful experience filled with friendliness, wholesomeness and professionalism. For those reasons, I would wholeheartedly recommend HMUN.

I was the delegate of Sudan at UNESCO in HMUN’19. The experience I gained was beyond just academics. Rather, it has helped me figure out how to improve myself and connect with other delegates and the chairs, all of whom I whole-heartedly treasure. The chairs were very welcoming and helpful, facilitating the committee’s progress and giving appropriate suggestions. The staff was friendly and attentive to the delegates. Together, HMUN’19 has been one of the most memorable experiences I’ve had in the last summer. Therefore, I am so happy to be part of the team this time, and to contribute to the organization. HMUN might be the initial gateway to some, or the place for heated debates to others. Be whatever it may, I hope that you too will all gain mesmerising experiences that lead you to a community of people with open minds and novel ideas. I am really looking forward to seeing you at HMUN’20.

I had never tried Model United Nations before Hanoi Model United Nations 2019. So when I saw the website for HMUN’19, I was like “Heck why not?” 

The Committee I decided to apply for was the Arab League which was a committee that really challenged the delegates in a good direction. In essence, everyone within the committee was technically the “bad guy”, and it would be easy for the committee to just turn into a blame competition. Luckily, my fellow delegates were very supportive of one another and we managed to get two resolutions done early and we had a really fun mini-crisis afterwards. 

What HMUN left me was a supportive and friendly community that made me feel appreciated for my interests and knowledge. Not only that, I was able to make many new friends whom I am very close to as they have supported me through my academic and personal adventures. 

I did not regret applying for HMUN’19 and I understand the application might look scary. But if you have a passion for International Relations and Social Issues, if you want to be in a supportive community then spend some time and fill out that application. Trust me you will be rewarded. A friend of mine in HMUN once said “HMUN is where love begins” and truly I found it.
