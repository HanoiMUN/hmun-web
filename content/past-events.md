# Our Pride

**Hanoi Model United Nations Organization** is extremely honored to have successfully held annual conferences since 2015 with participants coming from various high schools and universities to experience the professional environment. Through debates and diplomacy, participants not only became more aware of global affairs but were strongly encouraged to engage in solving them as well. Year after year, the organizers of HMUN come up with brand-new ideas to renovate the content as well as improve every aspect of each conference so that participants are guaranteed a rewarding experience every time they partake in our conferences.
