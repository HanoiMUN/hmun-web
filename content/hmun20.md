<br/>

I came to HMUN’20 without any expectation, yet left with bunches of elation. HMUN’20 was my first crisis council ever, needless to say, it was a joint historical council. The CDs and chairs were super funny and helpful. I felt more going through a play (well, we supposed to role-play in an HCC anyway) than a crisis, which I think is a good start for MUNewbies (in case you wonder, yes, I have just come up with that term). It was stressful enough to take a few hours off your sleep, but at the same time, joyful enough to render you delightful memories. Despite some slips in organizing, I could see how devoted the dais were in making and operating HMUN, which I really appreciate. For those slips, I believe that it would either be improved or belong to objective reasons (there would be alternatives for them, I reckon). I love the spirit of HMUN – their friendliness, warmth, supportiveness, and humility. I really look forward to their future conferences, as they will be filled up with to-be-sweet moments made by their sweet members.

With the color of hair and suit similar to the flag, I was the delegate of Greece in the European Union in HMUN’20. HMUN was not new to me since I was in the Arab League in HMUN'19 but this year's topic was very novel and challenging which truly captivated my curiosity. I was shocked at how long the guidebook was and I truly appreciated the hard work and thoughts the chairs had put into it. They have also been really friendly and helpful to every delegate with their amazing training and QnA sessions. The staff has also been really careful and attentive to everyone. This conference has been a chance for me to improve myself and share my interests with others. Besides, the workshops have also provided me with a lot of knowledge and advice from prominent guest speakers that I might not have the chance to experience elsewhere. Lastly, I have to mention the members of the EU who have made the memories of HMUN’20 much more unforgettable in my summer with their wholesomeness. 

I believe HMUN'20 is where people with willingness and effort can know more about themselves with the love and support of everyone within this community.

To me, HMUN’20 was such a memorable journey.

In my opinion, HMUN'20 was not only the first United Nations simulation conference that I attended, but it was also a place that helped me become stronger, more mature and more confident. Most importantly, it helped me to know how to think more thoroughly before making my own decisions. When I first applied to become a delegate of HMUN’20, I simply thought that this United Nations simulation conference would only help me become more gentle and polite because of its professionalism. However, this conference actually gave me much more than that. Not only does that lie in learning the professional skills from heated debates with other delegates, but also the little fun of chatting with friends from all other provinces, the thrill of hearing the inspirational words of the secretary-general and the chairs, and also the humor of the board going out to eat and take pictures together. I assure you that if you are brave enough to speak out in the conference room, dare to overcome our own hesitation to communicate with other people, you will learn a lot of things that teachers may feel difficult to convey to you at school.

Perhaps I cannot be called an “experienced MUN-er” to give you professional advice. But there is one thing I learned from the conference that I believe will be of great help. That is, you should always think through even the smallest things, because that will help you to succeed. If I remember correctly, the Secretary General of HMUN’20 asked us before the conference: “Who are you now and who you want to be after this conference?”. The question was short, but it gave me a great source of energy and motivation during the three days of the conference. As the question lingers on my mind, I am always aware that I have to work harder, both to contribute to the success of the conference and to make myself do something meaningful here, in order not to regret that I had a rare opportunity to work with extremely talented people.
