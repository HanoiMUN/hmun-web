# Past Conferences

**Hanoi Model United Nations** proudly set the first footsteps in organizing newbie-friendly conferences for its participants in 2015. Up to now, more than 200 delegates as countries’ representatives have made their decision on resolutions as well as addressed a variety of conflicts ranging from economic development to fantasy crisis. Among those, numerous awards and honorable mentions for excellent performance have been granted. Notably, participants are granted a chance to collaborate with their fellow future leaders through stimulating conversations and shared working papers on the path to a thorough resolution.
