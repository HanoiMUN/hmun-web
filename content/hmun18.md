# CONFERENCE THEME: CLASHES OF CIVILIZATIONS

The development of technology and digitized information is gradually bridging the gap between humans, thus making individuals more conscious of their religious identity and differences in cultures all over the world. This situation has intensified the clashes among civilizations in the modern society. With this theme, we want participants to gain in-depth knowledge about these cultural conflicts, and set a common ground among countries to foster a world of peace as well as unity.
