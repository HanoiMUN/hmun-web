<br/>

As the delegate of UNESCO in HMUN 21’, and former Director-General of HMUN 20’, I felt that HMUN is the playground for anyone to express their opinions while learning from others and enjoying themselves. UNESCO’s Chairs helped me a lot in my first experience as a newbie, which is one of many reasons why I would recommend HMUN to those new to the MUN community. At HMUN, I was able to become a better self by working with like-minded peers and improving my communications/critical thinking skills.

For me, HMUN’21 was a truly unique experience, not only because the conference had to be held online due to the pandemic, but also how it surpassed my initial expectations. Of course, not having an offline event took away a lot: the face-to-face interactions, the placards, the tea breaks,... However, I was still blown away by how enjoyable the whole experience was. My committee, the JHCC set during the American Revolution, was my first ever crisis council, and, with the help of the interesting plotline and exceptional works from the dais, it was by far the most thrill and excitement I have ever had from a MUN council. Not only did I learn a lot in terms of knowledge and experience from participating in HMUN’21, but I truly feel grateful for being able to meet so many people whom I admire and respect, and for all the devotion that the staff put into the event. And for all of that, HMUN’21 holds a special place in my heart.

HMUN was my first ever actual MUN conference outside of my school club and it was truly a precious experience for me. I was able to learn more about my interest in politics and discuss openly my views with others. The staff and Chairs were all incredibly helpful and friendly and we were able to form very close connections, making my entire HMUN experience much more fun and engaging. The format of HMUN was different from what I was used to, plus the online conference, so it was a little overwhelming at first. However, everyone was very thoughtful and the instructions given were clear and helpful.

In general, HMUN was a new and fun experience and I hope it stays the same for many new (and possibly old) members who are joining again.
