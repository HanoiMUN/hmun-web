# Our Past Mocks

Mock MUN, generally known as Mock Model United Nations, is in substance an international relations simulation of the Committee of regular Model UN conferences in which delegates interact with one another through debate and diplomacy to solve perplexing challenges facing the world today. By taking on the roles based upon genuine thereof United Nations, we can learn about the inner workings of global politics and develop comprehensive resolutions on pressing global issues as well as adopt a deeper understanding of current world issues. Having been together with the advent of HMUN, 13 Mock MUNs have hitherto been successfully organized and become an integral part of HMUN.
